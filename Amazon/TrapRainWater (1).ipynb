        "    Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ---To hold water, water should be surrounded by buildings on both left and right sidde where atleaast 1 building haas to bigger or equall \n",
        "    to height of water. Since we have to check both lleft andd right side, we need to find the minimum of 2 builldings on the lleft and right sidd\n",
        "    andd also nneed to consider the maximum on either side so that water doesn't overflow.\n",
